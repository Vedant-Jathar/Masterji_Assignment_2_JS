# Masterji_Assignment_2_JS
This is the Assignment 2 of Masterji based on HTML CSS and JS.
This is a project where i have fetched data about youtube videos from a free api and displayed the data on the frontend.
Even I have implemented a search button where you can filter the videos as you need.
I used DOM manipulation and "fetch().then()" mainly to complete this project.
